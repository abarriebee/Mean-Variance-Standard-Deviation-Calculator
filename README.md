# Mean Variance Standard Deviation Calculator

1. Create a function named calculate() in mean_var_std.py that uses Numpy to output the mean, variance, standard deviation, max, min, and sum of the rows, columns, and elements in a 3 x 3 matrix.
2. Input of the function should be a list containing 9 digits. The function should convert the list into a 3 x 3 Numpy array, and then return a dictionary containing the mean, variance, standard deviation, max, min, and sum along both axes and for the flattened matrix.
3. If a list containing less than 9 elements is passed into the function, it should raise a ValueError exception with the message: "List must contain nine numbers." The values in the returned dictionary should be lists and not Numpy arrays.
